The purpose of the “git reset” command is to move the current HEAD to the commit specified

git reset --hard
    throw away all my staged and unstaged changes,forget everything on my current local branch and make it exactly the same as

git reset --soft
    which will keep your files, and stage all changes back automatically

git reset --keep
    meant to be used when removing some of the last commits in the current branch while keeping changes in the working tree.
    
git reset --merge
